- NS: noisy signal
- S: original siganl
- mean filter: ws = window size
- median filter:
- average filter: ns = number of noisy signal(different)
- bandpass filter: l = low cut-off frequency, h = high ...
- threshold filter: r = ratio(max abs(fft) / min ...)
- wavelet filter: a = threshold
- std filter: 
- NN: neural network
